3D Conical Gaussian Heat Source Model 

Simple shunck of code to obtain a 3D Conical Gaussian to use in a Finite Element Method Simulation of a Laser Welding

The Code Outpoots a dataframe with the X,Y and Z positions of the gaussian, the radius of the spot at any giveng Z position and the heat output for the same position
